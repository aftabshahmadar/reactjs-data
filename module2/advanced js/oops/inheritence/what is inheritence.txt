what is inheritence ?

:- The JavaScript inheritance is a mechanism that allows us to create new classes on the basis of already existing classes. 
   It provides flexibility to the child class to reuse the methods and variables of a parent class.

:- The JavaScript extends keyword is used to create a child class on the basis of a parent class.
   It facilitates child class to acquire all the properties and behavior of its parent class.

   TYPE OF INHERITENCE -
   1. single inheritence :- there is only one child class derived from the one parent class using "extend" keyword.
   2. multilevel inheritence :- there is a chain system in this type of inheritence like a child class has its another derived class and so on.
