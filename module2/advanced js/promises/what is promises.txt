  js promises is an object that is links to in producing of code or consuming of code to performed any task there we used primises. 
  js promises is an object  that is perfomred some operations to handel asynchrounous in very easy way.
  js by default support asynchrounos. 


  Producing of code :any task will perfomed and take some times that is called producing of code
  Consuming of code :any task will performed and wait for result that is called consuming of code 

  what is promises operations :

     a:- pending : 
           A promises start from a pending states that meanse the process is not complete if the operations is successfully completed the process is go in fulfilled operations if operations get some errors it will be go inside of rejected.  
     b:- fullfilled

         A promises start from a pending states that meanse the process is not complete if the operations is successfully completed the process is go in fulfilled operations if operations get some errors it will be go inside of rejected.
        
     c:- rejected 

         A promises start from a pending states that meanse the process is not complete if the operations is successfully completed the process is go in fulfilled operations if operations get some errors it will be go inside of rejected.



    javascript promises chaining : 
       
         promises is very usefull when we handele multiple task at one times and handel asynchrounous oepartions very smothly.

         if one  after another task will be completed  there we used js promises chaining 
       
         try()  :  resolved
         .then():  fullfilled  
         catch():  rejected 
         finally : either it will be resolved or either it will be rejected.
